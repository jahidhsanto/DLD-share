This is a simple ask for you. Two integers will be given to you. You have to tell if the first number is divisible by 
the second number or not, that’s all.

Input Format:
Input starts with an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Then each contains two integers N, M.

Constraints:
T ≤ 10
-10^101 < N < 10^101
1 < M < 2^32

Output Format:
For each case, you have to print Case #: Yes or No, here # is the case number and Yes if N is divisible by M, No if N is not divisible by M. See sample input output for better understanding.

Sample Input 0:
3
9 3
8 3
-9 3

Sample Output 0:
Case 1: Yes
Case 2: No
Case 3: Yes
